# IPK-01 Testing Server

Author: **Tomáš Hobza** ([xhobza03](mailto:xhobza03@vutbr.cz)) @ FIT VUT 2024

## 📚 Info

Testing server for testing the TCP/UDP messaging client for the IPK project 01 of 2024 written in Python. Feel free to use it and modify it however you want.

> ⚠️ I am not an expert in communications nor Python so go on with caution. Any problems that you might find you can hit me up (email/discord) or create a PR.

## 🔄 Usage

The specific usage can be listed with the `-h` flag, but here's probably the most important stuff:

- `<path_to_executable>` - provide the path to the client executable
- `-p <udp|tcp>` - choose the tested protocol (default is both)
- `-d` - will show both `stdout` and `stdin` of the running client
- `-t <testcase_name>` - run a specific test case only

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

You might need to install `termcolor` if you don't have it yet using `pip3 install termcolor`.
