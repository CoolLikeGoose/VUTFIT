C204 - Infix to Postfix Expression Conversion, Basic Tests
==========================================================

[test_01] Upper and lower case characters with plus operator
Provided infix  : a+B=
Expected postfix: aB+=
Conversion match: OK



[test_02] Digits with minus operator
Provided infix  : 0-1=
Expected postfix: 01-=
Conversion match: OK



[test_03] Mixed operands with multiplication operator
Provided infix  : a*0=
Expected postfix: a0*=
Conversion match: OK



[test_04] Mixed operands with division operator
Provided infix  : B/1=
Expected postfix: B1/=
Conversion match: OK



[test_05] Simple parentheses support
Provided infix  : (a+b)=
Expected postfix: ab+=
Conversion match: OK



[test_06] Expression evaluation from the left to the right
Provided infix  : a+b+c=
Expected postfix: ab+c+=
Conversion match: OK



[test_07] Minus operator does not have higher priority than plus
Provided infix  : a+b-c=
Expected postfix: ab+c-=
Conversion match: OK



[test_08] Plus operator does not have higher priority than minus
Provided infix  : A-B+C=
Expected postfix: AB-C+=
Conversion match: OK



[test_09] Plus operator does not have higher priority than minus
Provided infix  : 1*2/3=
Expected postfix: 12*3/=
Conversion match: OK



[test_10] Parentheses change operator priority
Provided infix  : A+(B-c)=
Expected postfix: ABc-+=
Conversion match: OK



[test_eval_01] Evaluate expression
expression : (a+b)*(c-d)=
variables  : a = 5, b = 5, c = 12, d = 2
eval result: 100


[test_eval_02] Evaluate expression
expression : (a-b)*C=
variables  : a = 3, b = 5, C = -5
eval result: 10


[test_eval_03] Evaluate expression
expression : a*b+c/d=
variables  : a = 10, b = 3, c = 100, d = 5
eval result: 50
